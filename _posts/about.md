  Hi, my name is Evan, and I am a 4th year Mathematics, Computational and Statistical Sciences (MCSS) student at Yale-NUS College. I took on the MCSS major as a challenge, to see how I could think more logically and meticulously, which is a part of an answer to a larger philosophical question I posed to myself before college: "What do I need to learn in order to be a responsible citizen in society?". I believe that learning never stops, and I learn in order to be less ignorant and more aware of how I can contribute to society, whether it be through accumulating and applying knowledge, and through communicating responsibly and sincerely. This blog, is a repository of what I am learning day to day.

I have 2 old blogs, one on my internship experience at Metalworks, and another documenting my Japanese learning journey.

## Interests

Some of my interests include:

* Learning languages. Spent the last 3 years learning Japanese, and now trying to learn Spanish.
* Playing pool. Some of my heroes include [Ronnie O' Sullivan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McThDshEgU0), and [Efren Reyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXbYTHrsZZ4).
* Making a good cup of [coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw2uxM-HTb8). 
* Japanese culture. Inspired to learn by NHK Documentaries like [Trails to Tsukiji](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/vod/tsukiji/) and [The Professionals](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/professionals/).
* Cooking. Baked muffins, cakes and quiches at the Muffinry 3 years ago. Experimenting with [dishes from YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk2TdfB4LFc) from time to time.

As it may be evident, I enjoy doing things with tangible outputs, and enjoy things that offer me new ways of thinking about the way I live my life.

Drop me an [email](mailto: evanma92@gmail.com) if you want to catch a cup of coffee!

Thanks for reading!
