If you asked me, 8 months ago, what biodiversity was, I couldn't tell you. After a bit of reading up, I think I have a firmer grasp of why biodiversity is important, and why there is a need to simulate patterns of biodiversity (Essentially, my capstone).

_Biodiversity_

For decades, biodiversity has been measured by count of species. The argument was that if there is a greater number of species in a habitat, the more resilient it is to change, for example, changes in light intensity or water salinity. This is because by nature of having more species, the more varied and thus complex it would be. Thus, the likelihood of one change affecting changes in other species is low. 

One very interesting study by Copeland (1965) as outlined in Kormondy's book on Community Ecology, shines light on this argument for why species count is important. "Highly integrated and complexy interrelated communities" are relatively stable and can **respond** readily to various kinds of short-term environemntal changes that are not too severe. Thus a mature forest would be one that tends towards high diversity - with large number of ecological niches.

_Why a model is important_

From the previous paragraph, the hypothesis of a mature forest having high diversity, is one that is verbal, and not actually tested in the field. This is because actual ecological data is quite hard to obtain, and spans over many years of data collection. As a result, a model would first, be able to more concretely quantify this change in diversity over time, and secondly, be able to help ecologists generate other hypotheses that could be interesting for future research. 

_Different ways of quantifying species diversity_

In ecological literature, species richness is one way of saying a community is diverse. However, evenness is also another factor. See this comparison of 2 plots of land that have 3 species of trees each.

| Tree Species	| Plot 1   | Plot 2   |
|:-------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Saga			| 4		   | 10		  |
| Elm			| 4 	   | 1		  |
| Cendana		| 4 	   | 1 		  |

Both have the same number of species of trees, but it is evident that plot 1 is more diverse than plot 2. If you have so many of the same type of trees, then just imagine yourself walking through a forest with mostly saga trees. You would classify that as less diverse right?

Thus, there are 3 different indices that indicate different emphasis on species richness and evenness.
1. Species count: 		No emphasis on species evenness
2. Shannon diversity: 	More emphasis on species evenness
3. Simpson diversity: 	Most emphasis on species evenness

_Breaking news_

In a nature article a few weeks back, ecologists are now finding new ways to quantify species diversity, one of them being functional diversity. Advances in technology are enabling data processing, matrix multiplications to be done more efficiently, speeding up the building of a ecological traits database. A few years in time, data crunching of ecological data could be a thing for the future. 

More on my capstone / model soon.
