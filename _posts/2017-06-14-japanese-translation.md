I am working as a freelance Japanese-English translator part-time, and one of the difficulties I face is when translating from English to Japanese, what are the natural ways of speech that Japanese use in specific contexts, and how can I translate without losing the essence of the meaning. There are a few levels to this:
1. Syntactic - This preserves original information, but in certain contexts probably means absolutely nothing to the reader.
2. Contextual translation - Contextual words are used, and reader has an idea of what is going on.
3. Stylistic translation - Same level of respect is considered, and the reader understands the social hierarchy. 

A combination of all three are important, and balancing those is a translator's biggest priority. As I am translating, I face all three challenges, and I'll list some of them out here.

|No.  | Original English Text	  	 	 	 | Japanese Translation #1   | Japanese Translation #2   		|
|:---:|:------------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|1.   | Dearest Client   		  			 | お客様へ					 | 親愛なるお客様へ				 	|
|2.   | This survey is aimed at 			 | この調査の目的は      	     | この調査を通して。。。〜たく存じます 	|
|3.   | The results will not be attributed   | 結果を帰属させません 		 | 結果を帰属させないようにいたします　 	|

As you can see, especially for numbers 2 and 3, it is very easy to be direct and say, 「この調査の目的は」, but that seems a little blunt, and quite unlike Japanese speech, so I thought of phrasing it as 「この調査を通して」which softens the intention of the other party. To verify that my translations were correct, I fed it through Google and tried to see whether it fell in the right context or not. There could be a few results, but if those were used in an informal context, where I needed it to be in a business context, then I'd be in trouble. 

One thing that really surprised me, was that 親愛なるお客様 was used in Japanese business contexts. I am still trying to figure that out, so if anyone does, please let me know!

Also, some of my must-go-to websites while I'm doing translation are [Linguee](https://linguee.jp), [Weblio](https://ejje.weblio.jp) and good old [Google](https://google.com.sg).

Okay back to working on my translation!

P.S. I was wondering how best to translate the word "regional" and I thought, which was better, 地域 or 地方 and I found this ![explanation]({{site.baseurl}}/evanma92.github.io/_posts/region-explanation.png)
