## Job search

This semester, I’ve learnt that starting early always works for me. I started the job search early, applied to Hilti, Unilever, GSK, Grab, Goldman Sachs, Rolls Royce, and of all the companies I got through to the 2nd round for Hilti, Unilever, GSK and Goldman Sachs, to the 3rd round for Unilever, GSK and Goldman Sachs, and only the final round for GSK. I also applied for an internship with LucasFilm, got the internship, but ultimately turned it down to end my final semester in school on a high. I got the role with GSK in the end, and I am going to join them on the 2nd of July. 

I was reminded of the value of preparing way ahead in advance. I read up on all the companies I applied for, put in more effort for those companies that mattered more to me, and consulted CIPE frequently about any doubts I had. I spent time researching, crafting my cover letters, resumes, and with all the advice I had received, I managed to pull through all the way to the end. 

Some good advice I received include:
1. Writing down all the values that the company stands for, and find out which ones resonate to you most. 
2. Understanding where your main strengths and weaknesses are, and staying true to them throughout the whole process.
3. Understand where you want to be 5-10 years down the road. What kind of environment do you see yourself in?
4. I’ve learned rules of being professional, composed and calm, and a big part of it includes rehearsing and practicing. A lot of the job process can feel unnatural to you (pre-recorded video interviews, personality test games etc.), but taking the time to run through them a few times helps. 
5. Be yourself! This is advice that is repeated over and over again, and I think it loses its meaning after awhile. I took it to mean that you should spend some time introspecting and understanding what kind of person you are, who you want to be, and how you are working to get there. It includes consolidating certain values and beliefs that you hold very strongly to, and acting on them consistently. I think the concept of who you are changes all the time, depending on what kind of environment you are in, and who you have been influenced by. 

GSK, from first impressions, seems like a really solid company, with good values that I identify with. The assessors at the assessment centre were all very personable. They engaged me on things I really valued in, and I felt I could speak about myself freely without inhibitions. The case studies they provided were very interesting, and I felt motivated to analyse the scenarios of product launches, CSR motives, and the role play where I was placed in the position of a manager. 


## Suite Friendships

My suite has one of the most solid people I’ve met. I’ve come to known Kai as this really well-balanced person, who reins in his emotions but is able to talk about it reasonably. He’s also a real stickler for tidiness and really keeps the suite clean. I’ve come to known Gabe as someone who is actually really smart, but doesn’t show it. She is very vulnerable and speaks about her troubles very genuinely, and her struggle with her transformation is eye-opening. Both of them have been my main pillars of support this semester, talking about everything and anything, from wine nights, to the wine fiesta, to watching game of thrones, to going out for dinners, gossiping, and really, being there for each other when we need be. They are the first people I think about when there is something nice to share, and they are my first point of contact for almost everything. I am so grateful for their presence, and filling the little void I had with my LDR. I will miss them terribly over the break.


## Academic balance

This semester, I believe I truly found academic balance. I took one intensive math course on differential equations, one computing course on database systems, one history course on the history of Tokyo, and then capstone. I realise I thrive by immersing in different topics to a deep level, and taking the time to understand and absorb everything. I had a balance of difficult courses, easy courses and that gave me the flexibility to manage my time better. In differential equations, I now have a toolbox where I can analyse physical systems mathematically and come up with solutions based on boundary and initial conditions. In database systems, I know how to store data efficiently without redundancy (Third and Boyce-Codd Normal Forms) and query data from a database with relatively complex queries. I managed to create a web app with my teammates to run a crowd-funding website. We learned PHP and SQL and how to work with Bootstrap. In my Historical Immersion class, I learned how one can look at history through multiple angles. Through literature we can see how writers have reacted against or with the times of the age, pick up on material cues or linguistic cues that corroborate with artefacts or documents that were discovered. Through woodblock prints one can understand the technologies present in the time, social class structures of the geishas / labourers / merchants, and the way national identities may have been constructed. I have learned that what appears to be natural in society may not be inherent, but something that was built over time, foundations laid by governments, and perhaps a social culture cultivated over time.
