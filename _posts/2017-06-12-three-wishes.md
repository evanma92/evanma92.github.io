I wrote this poem last week in Boston, out of concern for a person whom I thought too rationally about things. A few thoughts on what it means to feel, and listen to one's own feelings.

To a person,  
Who I respect and admire  
But three wishes from me  
To him, that I hope he takes  
With grace and acceptance.  

That he treats people unlike  
The way he treats his code.  
People are not black and white,  
Not all logical and goal oriented.  
To understand people is to  
Listen and explore  
Their emotional landscape,  
Which could match yours exactly,  
Or as different as snowy mountains are to grassy plains.  

That he learns to forgive and give second chances,  
Or third chances, or fourth,  
Or however many necessary,  
For people who are not dispensable as  
Toilet paper is to us.  
Bayesian priors, no matter how strong,  
Can always be updated by a sudden turn  
Of events, for they are always based on  
Past events that do not necessarily speak  
To the future.  
No Bayesian prior will help you predict  
Your next perfectly cooked mushroom dish that is completely out of your expectations  
Nor, the person who has changed beyond what you expect, and is willing to help you change,  
because simply,  
It did not exist in your prior.  
So I wish he does not become constrained  
By his prior,  
For the more he is constrained,  
The firmer his beliefs,  
The less he learns.  
And the depths of experience and learning  
Goes way beyond what he or I can  
Ever imagine.  

That he opens his heart  
That closing his heart makes him  
A more confused person,  
Because he is trapped in his emotions,  
Relegating them to pure logic,  
Explaining them away with words,  
When emotions are there to be felt.  

Observed.

And shared.
