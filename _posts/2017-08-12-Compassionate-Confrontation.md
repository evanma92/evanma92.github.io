Yesterday was symbolic for many reasons. It was a day that marked the end of orientation, the start of school life for the first years, start of my life as a senior in college, and the start of uncertainty. 

Over the summer, I've had the privilege of working on one thing at a time, undisturbed by other pursuits, and being able to immerse fully in whatever I was doing. For 1.5 months I delved into my research, for 2 weeks I attended my brother's graduation and bonded with family, for 2 weeks I presented my research in Mexico, traveled to archaeological ruins and cities of the YucatÃ¡n, for 2 weeks I was trained in active listening, inter-cultural conflict, alcohol intervention, mental health as preparation for my role as a Residential College Advisor (RCA), before another 2 weeks of taking freshmen on orientation and a trip to Surabaya, Indonesia, helping them adjust to life in school, getting to know them better, and sneaking in time to prepare for capstone and the job hunt. 

The summer does sound like a lot, not the least cause I was able to immerse and live out that experience to the fullest. As I rued not being able to get internship opportunities, I was at the same time happy that I was able to make the most out of my summer. 

Now as school is starting, I am readying myself to juggle multiple courses at the same time, being a peer counsellor, playing volleyball, getting involved in the community and starting the job hunt. But before I start looking forward (assignments are already due oh my goodness), I think I wanna take a bit of time to reflect on a few words that have been said in school, and a few thoughts I had about community. 

> Intimacy comes at a price. - Andrew Bailey. 

We will hurt each other with words that we have said or things we have done. We will annoy the heck out of each other. But the joys of living with one another, learning from different viewpoints, having fun together, crying together, feeling together, is a price worth paying for. To add on to Andrew Bailey's words, I think that communicating vulnerability, is one of the most beautiful things we can do in this modern age. In a time where there is a lot of posturing (especially amongst the first years), where we try to position ourselves in contrast to others, I think we need to explore how we really feel and communicate that to others. If you feel annoyed, say it. But also say why you think so. If you don't know why you feel annoyed, then take that time to talk about it and find out why.

Over my time at Yale-NUS, one thing that I regret the most, is probably not talking about things more, despite how awkward or confrontational it can get. I am on the extremely non-confrontational end of the spectrum, and will try to avoid conflict no matter what, but slowly, I am understanding the importance of *compassionate confrontation*. Sounds like an oxymoron right? What confrontation is compassionate? 

As one of my students put it out rightly, all confrontation takes energy and time. If you truly didn't care for a person, why would you spend the time and energy to talk to them? Why would you cry or get frustrated by them? Being ignored, is the strongest form of apathy. It is nihilism, the thinking that nothing is there. Nothing to fight for, nothing to argue about, nothing to feel for. I used to draw the fine balance between observation and inaction, but far too often, I have observed but not acted on it. Some people think that to act involves some big paradigm shifting, tension escalating behavior, but it need not be so. It can be a simple question to clarify context. It can be a conversation held in private. It can be simply listening to someone rant and being next to them. It can, simply be a handwritten note to show one's concern / care. 

The word confrontation has been tainted by people's actions far too long. It is associated with aggression, shouting, a refusal to listen, an argument. But the word confrontation can also mean to simply come face to face with. We can change the way we confront something we are uncomfortable with. We can be more compassionate by putting ourselves out of the centre picture. Being compassionate involves understanding, because to show concern requires understanding. 

I am grateful for the community I have made at Yale-NUS, and the generous lessons I have learned from the class of 2017. As I pass on this understanding to the class of 2021, I hope they too, live a life of compassion, understanding and grace.
